### üöÄ List of Experiments / Exercises

#### 1. **Simple Form Validation using JavaScript**
   - **Objective:** Create a webpage to validate user inputs, such as name, email, and password, using JavaScript.
   - **Result:** A functional webpage that ensures proper data entry and displays error messages for invalid inputs.

#### 2. **Interactive CGPA Calculator using Event Handling**
   - **Objective:** Design a webpage that allows users to calculate CGPA interactively using event-handling techniques.
   - **Result:** A dynamic CGPA calculator that updates results based on user input, improving interactivity.

#### 3. **Web Application with HTTP Request and HTTP Response**
   - **Objective:** Demonstrate the use of HTTP Request and Response methods in web applications.
   - **Result:** Successfully implemented an application where HTTP GET and POST requests fetch and submit data.

#### 4. **Simple Login Page using GET and POST Methods**
   - **Objective:** Develop a login page where event handling is performed using the GET and POST HTTP methods.
   - **Result:** A login page that processes user input and responds with validation results using GET and POST.

#### 5. **Simple Calculator using 'Modules' in Node.js**
   - **Objective:** Create a server-side calculator application by leveraging modules in Node.js.
   - **Result:** A Node.js-based server application that calculates results for basic arithmetic operations.

#### 6. **Server-Side Application using Routing in Express**
   - **Objective:** Design a web application showcasing how a server-side application responds to client requests using routing in Express.js.
   - **Result:** A functional Express application that handles multiple routes and responds dynamically to client requests.

#### 7. **Personal Information Maintenance using CRUD in MongoDB**
   - **Objective:** Create a webpage to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on personal information stored in MongoDB.
   - **Result:** Successfully implemented CRUD operations, allowing users to add, view, update, and delete records.

#### 8. **Personal Information Maintenance using CRUD in PostgreSQL**
   - **Objective:** Similar to Experiment 7, but with PostgreSQL as the database backend for CRUD operations.
   - **Result:** A PostgreSQL-based CRUD application that manages personal data effectively.

#### 9. **Web Application using Components and Modules in React**
   - **Objective:** Design a React web application by breaking it into components and utilizing modules.
   - **Result:** A modular React application with reusable components.

#### 10. **Web Application with Routing in React**
   - **Objective:** Create a React application with navigation and routing using `react-router`.
   - **Result:** A fully functional React app with multiple pages and seamless navigation.

#### 11. **Implementation of Various Hooks in ReactJS**
   - **Objective:** Explore and implement different React Hooks, such as `useState`, `useEffect`, `useContext`, etc.
   - **Result:** Demonstrated the effective use of React Hooks to manage state and side effects.
